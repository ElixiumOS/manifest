Getting Started

To build Elixium you need to donwload our source.

To initialize your local repository, use this command:

repo init -u https://github.com/mj1687/manifest.git -b elixium-7.1

Now it's time to sync, use this command:

repo sync -j32

(-j32 is optional, the default is -j4, if you have a fast cpu you can upgrade your -j values to -j32 or more)
